The GPOPS-II Code can be run as follows:

run TwoPhaseMain.m for the Two Phase Problem

run OnePhaseBank.m for the One Phase Unpowered Problem using Bank Angle Control

run OnePhaseThrust.m for the One Phase Powered Problem using Throttle Control of the SRP

There are settings within each code to comment in/out different entry vehicles and different SRP systems. These are located near the top of the code, under Auxiliary Data.
